⚡In this GitHub repository, you can find examples of using 𝐒𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐄𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥(), 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭(), 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐭() and combinations of these LINQ types.

🔸 𝐒𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐄𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥(): Use SequenceEqual() to determine if two collections are equal by comparing their elements in order.

🔸 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭(): Use Except() to find all values in one list that are not in the other list.

🔸 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐭(): Use Intersect() to find all values in one list that are also in the other list.

◾ 𝐒𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐄𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐬(): SequenceEqual() compares two different collections to see if they are equal
◾ 𝐒𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐄𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐬() - When using a collection of objects, SequenceEqual() performs a comparison to see if the two object references point to the same object
◾ 𝐒𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐄𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐫() - Use an EqualityComparer class to determine if the objects are the same based on the values in properties

◾ 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐬() - Find all values in one list that are not in the other list
◾ 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬() - Find all products that do not have sales
◾ 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐫() - Find all products that are in one list but not the other using a comparer class

◾ 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐁𝐲() - Find products within a collection that DO NOT compare to a List<string> against a specified property in the collection.
◾ 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐁𝐲𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬() - Find all products that do not have sales using a 'int' key selector

◾ 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐞𝐫𝐬() - Intersect() finds all values in one list that are also in the other list
◾ 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬() - Find all products that have sales
◾ 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐫() - Find all products that are in common between two collections using a comparer class

◾ 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐁𝐲() - Find products within a collection by comparing a List<string> against a specified property in the collection.
◾ 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐁𝐲𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝() - Find all products that have sales using a 'int' key selector
